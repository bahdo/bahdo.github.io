title: Building my NBA MVP Predictor
---

For as long as I can remember I’ve been a big fan of basketball. I enjoy playing basketball, watching basketball, and following and debating the NBA. One of the biggest conversations in basketball is comparing different players to each other and who should be awarded certain accolades. This most prestigious of which in the NBA is the Most Valuable Player award. This is awarded to whom the voters deem as, you guessed it, the most valuable player in the league. Growing up when debating one player over another I would always use stats to back up my arguments. So when I decided to take on a project to do on my own time this fall semester I decided to see if I can use a machine learning model to accurately predict which players would win the MVP award.

The first challenge I ran into was determining how to decide if a player wins or not. Looking deeper into the process for determining MVP I saw that 121 selected voters were to assign players votes ranging from first place (most valuable) to fifth place (fifth most valuable). Historically, it comes down to who gets the most first place votes. There hasn’t been an instance of a player winning the award from getting a lot of 2nd place votes. So I decided to predict the amount of first place votes a player would get.

The next challenge I faced was which statistics I would use to predict the number of votes. Using basketball-reference.com to collect the stats, I took every player that received votes for MVP in the past 10 years and recorded their advanced statistics. I chose advanced statistics because they can give a better indication on a player’s performance and impact on the game. In addition to this I didn’t base predictions on the players’ raw stats rather I chose their rank in the league for the year. Reason being, the MVP award is given to the most valuable player for that year. Just using the raw numbers would have the model make predictions based on every players performance in the history of the league rather than against the performances of other players from that season. Doing this I had the necessary to make predictions. After performing a feature selection I decided on using three different statistics: PER (Player Efficiency Rating), VORP (Value Over Replacement Player), and WS (Win Shares). PER was a statistic made by John Holligner which "sums up all a player's positive accomplishments, subtracts the negative accomplishments, and returns a aper-minute rating of a player's performance." As per Basketball-Reference.com, VORP is "an estimate of each player's overall contribution to the team, measured vs. what a theoretical "replacement player" would provide." The top 10 seasons all time for VORP is a list populated by Michael Jordan, LeBron James, David Robinson, and Chris Paul, all players who have finished at least top two in MVP voting. Basketball-Reference.com defines Win Shares as "Win Shares is a player statistic which attempts to divvy up credit for team success to the individuals on the team." With all of these stats available I was ready to begin doing some analysis.

When choosing an algorithm to predict a player's received votes I chose to a regression algorithm rather than a classification because the number of votes received is a continuous numerical result rather than a discrete one that would be better suited for a classifier. I began with a simple Linear Regression.

A simple Linear Regression posed two problems for this data set. One was that the algorithm only accepted a single input variable where I had many and two it had rather mediocre performance. With a Root Mean Squared Error of 11.87 I knew it was possible to get better performance. In an attempt to better utilize the data I decided to use a multi-dimensional Linear Regression. This algorithm works similar to the previously used one however it uses multiple input variables. Uses all three input variables rather than one I got a slightly better Root Mean Squared Error. 

A big problem with Linear Regression in this application is the data used isn't linear as demonstrated by this graph of Votes and PER
